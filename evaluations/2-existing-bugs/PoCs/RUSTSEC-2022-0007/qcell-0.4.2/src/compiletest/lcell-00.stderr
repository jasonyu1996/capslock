error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `owner1`
 --> $DIR/lcell-00.rs:9:26

7 |     LCellOwner::scope(|mut owner1| {
  |                        ---------- move occurs because `owner1` has type `LCellOwner<'_>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
8 |         let owner2 = owner1;
  |                      ------ value moved here
9 |         let rc = Rc::new(owner1.cell(100u32)); // Compile fail
  |                          ^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
