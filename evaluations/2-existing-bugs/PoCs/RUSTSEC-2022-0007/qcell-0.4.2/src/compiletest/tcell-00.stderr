error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `owner1`
  --> $DIR/tcell-00.rs:12:22
   |
10 |     let mut owner1 = ACellOwner::new();
   |         ---------- move occurs because `owner1` has type `TCellOwner<Marker>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
11 |     let mut owner2 = owner1;
   |                      ------ value moved here
12 |     let rc = Rc::new(owner1.cell(100u32));  // Compile fail
   |                      ^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
