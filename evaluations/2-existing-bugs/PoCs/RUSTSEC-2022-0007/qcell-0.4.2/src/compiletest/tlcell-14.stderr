error[E0277]: `Rc<()>` cannot be sent between threads safely
 --> $DIR/tlcell-14.rs:9:5

8 |     fn is_send<T: Send>() {}
  |                   ---- required by this bound in `is_send`
9 |     is_send::<TLCell<Marker, Rc<()>>>();  // Compile fail
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Rc<()>` cannot be sent between threads safely
  |
  = help: the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<()>`
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Send` for `TLCell<Marker, Rc<()>>`
