## Evaluations

This directory contains files (data and scripts) used in the experiments
covered in Section 6 of the paper.
Each subdirectory corresponds to one or two subsections.

The `common` subdirectory contains data and scripts common to all experiments.
In particular, it contains scripts for downloading and processing crates from crates.io.
These scripts are provided for reference.
It is not necessary to use them to run the experiments. The relevant data
is already provided in the experiment subdirectories.
